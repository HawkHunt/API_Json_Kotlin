# API_Json_Kotlin

this application will not work when cloned
In MainActivity.kt at line 51 there is a variable called applicationID, which is an empty string
Applications like this one, who use WarGamingLimited's API are to be registered with WarGaming and are not to be distributed.
Therefore the author's own Application ID is omitted from the code. 

Should this code need to be employed, the user of this code should register an appplication with WarGamingLimited and post it in the code.
